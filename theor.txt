scope of a variable is the region in code where the existence of variable is valid
based on scope variables are of two types - global and local
local varibles are declared inside a fn/block and are valid only in that fn
global var. are declared outside of all fn and are valid throught the entire file
DATA TYPES -
data types define the types of data a variable can hold (eg - a character type 
variable can hold a character data)
in cpp data types are of three types - built in(stud in cmmnt and var file) 
,user defined and derived.
user defined data types- struct , union and enum
derived data types - arrays functions and pointers
**local and global variables can have same name but local takes precendence.(refer lowglow)
